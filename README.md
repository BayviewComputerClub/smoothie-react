# smoothie-react

The new(?) user interface for Smoothie (built in React).

Uses smoothie-web as a backend, make sure to have that running.

## Running it

Make sure you have the latest NodeJS LTS, and Yarn installed.

```shell script
yarn # Install dependancies, you only need to run this once.
yarn start # Starts the development server on localhost:3000
```

To create a production build, run ``yarn build``.
